# _luox_

_A user-friendly, open-access platform for calculating quantities related to light and lighting_

### Citing

We are currently (January 2021) in the process of writing a report presenting _luox_ and will update this information here.

### Usage

#### Sharing spectra and calculations using sharing URL

Spectra and calculations within the luox platform can be shared using an URL that directly encodes the uploaded spectrum/spectra using Michael Herf's [spdurl](https://github.com/herf/spdurl) package. The sharing URL will open a view-only version of the platform. To copy the sharing URL, scroll down to the bottom of the page. Before sharing the URL, please double-check that it opens spectrum/spectra as expected.

#### Requesting DOI for sharing URL

We offer the option to request a digital object identifier (DOI) linked to the sharing URL. This DOI has to be requested manually and the request will be vetted manually. To request a DOI, please complete this [form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=G96VzPWXk0-0uv5ouFLPkZQkeC9QuStHlpH3Nt-sDo1URExCVlBCNFdNWk02TDVVVFhYSkUyMUxETi4u). The DOI will be generated by generating an entry for the sharing URL in the [Oxford University Research Archive (ORA)](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/) and author information will be included in the record. All luox sharing URLs added to ORA will receive a unique luox number of the format (`YYYY-####`; `Y`=year). A running list of luox sharing URLs with associated DOIs is on this page, under [List of sharing URLs](#list-of-sharing-urls). Please note that deposition of the sharing URL into ORA is permanent.

There is no guarantee that DOI requests will be accepted. To ensure that a DOI is generated in a timely fashion, please submit the request well before it is needed (e.g. in a publication submission). We are currently investigating the possibility of generating DOIs directly without using ORA.


### Developers

This platform was developed by [Dr Manuel Spitschan](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/team/manuel-spitschan) (Department of Experimental Psychology, Unversity of Oxford) and [Go Free Range](https://gofreerange.com/).
