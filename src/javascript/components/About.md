## About

### Purpose

The purpose of the _luox_ platform is to faciliate the calculation of quantities related to light and lighting in a user-friendly, open-access and free fashion. Users can upload spectra (which are only stored in the browser) and the platform will calculate relevant quantites (including (il)luminance, chromaticity, and α-opic (ir)radiance and α-opic daylight (il)luminances) from the spectra, generate a visualisation of the spectrum, and enable the export of calculations in tabular form. All quantities reported here are supported by the [International Commission on Illumination (CIE)](https://cie.co.at/).

The platform is primarily geared towards researchers and research users interested in the effects of light exposure on human physiology and behaviour, but it may be interesting to students, academics and professionals in other disciplines and areas.

_luox_ is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### Team

This platform was developed by [Dr Manuel Spitschan](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/team/manuel-spitschan) (Department of Experimental Psychology, Unversity of Oxford) and [Go Free Range](https://gofreerange.com/).

We are currently (January 2021) in the process of writing a report presenting _luox_ and will update this information here.

When reporting quantites related to CIE S 026, we also recommend citing the standard:

### Contributing code of conduct

We welcome contributions. To contribute code, [please create a fork and issue a pull request on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

#### Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

##### Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

##### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

##### Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

##### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

##### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement via email at [luox-support@psy.ox.ac.uk](mailto:luox-support@psy.ox.ac.uk). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

##### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

###### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

###### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

###### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

###### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction withi
the community.

## Usage

### Quick start

We provide a documented wizard for uploading your files to the platform.

### Sharing spectra and calculations using sharing URL

Spectra and calculations within the luox platform can be shared using an URL that directly encodes the uploaded spectrum/spectra using Michael Herf's [spdurl](https://github.com/herf/spdurl) package. The sharing URL will open a view-only version of the platform. To copy the sharing URL, scroll down to the bottom of the page. Before sharing the URL, please double-check that it opens spectrum/spectra as expected.

### Requesting DOI for sharing URL

We offer the option to request a digital object identifier (DOI) linked to the sharing URL. This DOI has to be requested manually and the request will be vetted manually. To request a DOI, please complete this [form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=G96VzPWXk0-0uv5ouFLPkZQkeC9QuStHlpH3Nt-sDo1URExCVlBCNFdNWk02TDVVVFhYSkUyMUxETi4u). The DOI will be generated by generating an entry for the sharing URL in the [Oxford University Research Archive (ORA)](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/) and author information will be included in the record. All luox sharing URLs added to ORA will receive a unique luox number of the format (`YYYY-####`; `Y`=year). A running list of luox sharing URLs with associated DOIs is on this page, under [Depositions](#depositions). Please note that deposition of the sharing URL into ORA is permanent.

There is no guarantee that DOI requests will be accepted. To ensure that a DOI is generated in a timely fashion, please submit the request well before it is needed (e.g. in a publication submission). We are currently investigating the possibility of generating DOIs directly without using ORA.

## Under the hood

### Calculation definitions

All calculations performed here following guidance from the [International Commission on Illumination (CIE)](https://cie.co.at/).

### Precision and decimal points

All calculations are computed with floating point precision using JavaScript. In the browser, the results are displayed up to four decimals for all quantities (including those in _Advanced_ mode). When downloading calculations, the precision will be higher than displayed in the browser.

### Implementation specifics

While calculation procedures are structurally well-defined by the CIE, there are a few ambiguities that may arise when implementing it. This includes the choice of specific and exchangeable algorithms (e.g. for the calculation of CCT), and the decimal points of specific constants. The specific choices are described here:

| Aspect                                         | Quantity                                          | Method or quantity used in luox | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Constant for absolute (il)luminance conversion | Illuminance [lx] and Luminance [cd/m<sup>2</sup>] | 683.0015478 lm/W                | 683 lm/W acceptable "for all practical applications" according to [ISO 23539:2005/CIE S 010:2004](http://cie.co.at/publications/photometry-cie-system-physical-photometry), 683.0015478 lm/W exact value used in the [CIE S 026 toolbox](https://doi.org/10.25039/S026.2018.TB); usually rounded up to 683.002 lm/W |

## About

### Purpose

The purpose of the _luox_ platform is to faciliate the calculation of quantities related to light and lighting in a user-friendly, open-access and free fashion. Users can upload spectra (which are only stored in the browser) and the platform will calculate relevant quantites (including (il)luminance, chromaticity, and α-opic (ir)radiance and α-opic daylight (il)luminances) from the spectra, generate a visualisation of the spectrum, and enable the export of calculations in tabular form. All quantities reported here are supported by the [International Commission on Illumination (CIE)](https://cie.co.at/).

The platform is primarily geared towards researchers and research users interested in the effects of light exposure on human physiology and behaviour, but it may be interesting to students, academics and professionals in other disciplines and areas.

_luox_ is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### Team

This platform was developed by [Dr Manuel Spitschan](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/team/manuel-spitschan) (Department of Experimental Psychology, Unversity of Oxford) and [Go Free Range](https://gofreerange.com/).

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

##### Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

##### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

##### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement via email at [luox-support@psy.ox.ac.uk](mailto:luox-support@psy.ox.ac.uk). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

##### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

###### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

###### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

###### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

###### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction withi
the community.

## Usage

### Quick start

We provide a documented wizard for uploading your files to the platform.

### Sharing spectra and calculations using sharing URL

Spectra and calculations within the luox platform can be shared using an URL that directly encodes the uploaded spectrum/spectra using Michael Herf's [spdurl](https://github.com/herf/spdurl) package. The sharing URL will open a view-only version of the platform. To copy the sharing URL, scroll down to the bottom of the page. Before sharing the URL, please double-check that it opens spectrum/spectra as expected.

### Requesting DOI for sharing URL

We offer the option to request a digital object identifier (DOI) linked to the sharing URL. This DOI has to be requested manually and the request will be vetted manually. To request a DOI, please complete this [form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=G96VzPWXk0-0uv5ouFLPkZQkeC9QuStHlpH3Nt-sDo1URExCVlBCNFdNWk02TDVVVFhYSkUyMUxETi4u). The DOI will be generated by generating an entry for the sharing URL in the [Oxford University Research Archive (ORA)](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/) and author information will be included in the record. All luox sharing URLs added to ORA will receive a unique luox number of the format (`YYYY-####`; `Y`=year). A running list of luox sharing URLs with associated DOIs is on this page, under [Depositions](#depositions). Please note that deposition of the sharing URL into ORA is permanent.

There is no guarantee that DOI requests will be accepted. To ensure that a DOI is generated in a timely fashion, please submit the request well before it is needed (e.g. in a publication submission). We are currently investigating the possibility of generating DOIs directly without using ORA.

## Under the hood

### Calculation definitions

All calculations performed here following guidance from the [International Commission on Illumination (CIE)](https://cie.co.at/).

### Precision and decimal points

All calculations are computed with floating point precision using JavaScript. In the browser, the results are displayed up to four decimals for all quantities (including those in _Advanced_ mode). When downloading calculations, the precision will be higher than displayed in the browser.

### Implementation specifics

While calculation procedures are structurally well-defined by the CIE, there are a few ambiguities that may arise when implementing it. This includes the choice of specific and exchangeable algorithms (e.g. for the calculation of CCT), and the decimal points of specific constants. The specific choices are described here:

| Aspect                                         | Quantity                                          | Method or quantity used in luox | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
